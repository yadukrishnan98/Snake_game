## Snake game

A pet project of a snake game built using Python and the turtle graphics module - turtle. A scoreboard was implemented that displays high scores for respective players across sessions of the game. The database on the backend was implemented using SQLite.

# How to play?

Clone the repository to your local machine and run the main.py file using the command line or your preferred editor. The game will prompt you for your name. Once you've entered your name and clicked on 'OK', you're good to play.
Once you've exited the game, the console will then print out the top 5 high scores across all sessions of the game.
